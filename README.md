Overview
The Fabric Powered Energy Horizon project leverages the power of Microsoft Fabric and advanced statistical modeling to predict the future trends in energy production. This project specifically focuses on forecasting renewable and non-renewable electricity generation based on historical data. By utilizing a robust ARIMA time series forecasting model, we aim to provide actionable insights into the evolution of energy production over the next five years.

This solution utilizes PySpark for large-scale data processing and ARIMA for time series forecasting, offering a scalable approach to energy prediction that can be adapted to other regions or datasets.

Key Features
Energy Forecasting: Predicts the future energy generation (renewable and non-renewable) using ARIMA.

Time Series Analysis: Uses historical data to model trends and generate forecasts.

Microsoft Fabric Integration: Leverages Microsoft Fabric for efficient data processing and seamless integration with cloud services.

Confidence Intervals: Provides forecast values along with lower and upper confidence intervals for better decision-making.

Scalable: Built to handle large datasets using PySpark, making it suitable for various energy production datasets across different regions.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Fabric: Provides the platform for large-scale data processing and analysis.

PySpark: Handles distributed data processing and transformation at scale.

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Time series forecasting model used for predicting future energy trends.

Pandas UDFs (User Defined Functions): For parallel processing of forecasts across different entities and energy types.

Python Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation.

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

statsmodels for ARIMA time series forecasting.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Spark 3.x (with PySpark)

Microsoft Fabric (for cloud integration)

ARIMA module from statsmodels

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, pyspark

Install Required Packages
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pyspark
Ensure Spark and Microsoft Fabric are properly configured as per your environment's setup.

Usage
Data Loading: The project begins by loading energy generation data from a CSV file into a PySpark DataFrame:

python
Copy
Edit
energy_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("path/to/data.csv")
Data Transformation: The data is then transformed into a long format, making it suitable for time series forecasting:

python
Copy
Edit
long_df = energy_df.select("Entity", "Year", "Urbanization", ...)
Time Series Forecasting: A custom pandas_udf is used to apply the ARIMA model to each group of data. This model forecasts the next 5 years of energy generation data:

python
Copy
Edit
forecast_results = forecast_ready.groupby('Entity', 'EnergyType').apply(forecast_energy)
Results: After applying the model, the forecast results are cached for performance, and you can display the first 20 rows:

python
Copy
Edit
display(forecast_results.limit(20))
The result includes:

Entity: The region or entity for which the forecast is made.

EnergyType: The type of energy (e.g., wind, solar, hydro).

Year: The forecasted year.

Forecast: The predicted energy generation.

Lower_CI and Upper_CI: The confidence intervals for the forecasted values.

Limitations
Data Availability: The model requires a minimum of five years of historical data to make reliable forecasts. The results may not be accurate if the dataset lacks sufficient history.

F2 SKU Capacity Limitation: Due to current capacity constraints, the exploration was limited, which affected the scalability and the depth of the model. Future implementations could benefit from increased processing power and storage resources.

Model Tuning: The ARIMA model used here is configured with default parameters ((1,1,1)), which may not be optimal for all datasets. Fine-tuning the parameters or exploring other forecasting models could improve performance.

Future Work
Model Optimization: Explore advanced techniques for model selection and optimization (e.g., Grid Search for ARIMA parameters).

Scalability: Implement the solution at a larger scale, potentially integrating more data points and different energy types.

Cloud Integration: Enhance the integration with Microsoft Fabric for automatic updates, real-time forecasting, and scalability.
